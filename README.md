Fix - UnAttach from game and leave the casino sit outside run around do whatever for 1 minute then enter the casino again, go sit at the roulette table and re-attach should fix the issue.

Ban Bypass : 

The game does have a way to prevent you from winnning a large amount of chips in one session and thats by preventing you from betting once youve won so much.
To bypass this use the modded bet ammount this isnt seen as a large bet but rather 10 chips by the game so you'll be able to win as much as you like without getting a temp ban.

Q : Is this detected?

Q : What roulette tables does this work with?

A : All tables including highroller!
